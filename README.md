# Da Vinci Controller
I am creating a low-cost haptic feedback controller for my Robotics in Medical Imaging course that interfaces with a Da Vinci Needle Driver end effector made by Intuitive Surgical.

Inspired by high-tech and industrial machinery, I want to build a low-cost and personalized version of a surgical instrument controller. This project will be made with all the parts I own and have at home: a Da Vinci Needle Driver, servo motors, an RPi Pico W, 3D-printed parts, linear encoders, optical encoders, Hall sensors, etc.

This is a rushed process to be completed in 7 weeks, so let's see how this will go!
